**All code is designed to run on ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04**


*LIDAR / Navigation* Usage:

BUILD:
1. Must have sick_scan_XD installed to work with LIDAR; follow instruction for "Build on Linux ROS1 here" https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/blob/master/INSTALL-ROS1.md#build-on-linux-ros1
2. Install Hector SLAM: sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-hector-slam
3. Clone this 'catkin_ws' and build with 'catkin_make'

PACKAGE INFO:
- ranger_2dnav:  This package contains all the path-planning contents & the combined allâ€“in-one
launch file called ranger_start.launch. It contains the ROS move_base launch, all required (and tunable) nav parameters, starts Hector SLAM, and the pyserial interface to connect an Arduino

- ranger_actionlib: This package starts the Action Server to send/receive feedback from the navigation path planner. It sends waypoints goals (capable of sending in a GPS coordinate frame as well -- NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED) and can convert GPS frame coordinates to the local map frame.

- sabertooth_rospy: This package (specifically the CmdVelToMotors node) subscribes to the /cmd_vel topic and converts the velocity commands to differential wheel velocity inputs (based on robot geometry) and publishes this information in a special string format, which is received by a ROS subscriber on an Arduino.


*Camera - IN PROGRESS*

Running the code
(must have camera connected. This is for ROS Noetic)

```roscore
cd catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
rosloaunch pointcloud_to_lasercan ranger.launch```

*IMU Phidget Spatial 3/3/3*

Build:
1. Follow: https://github.com/ros-drivers/phidgets_drivers to get phidget drivers installed
2. Reinstall from a different source to fix build: sudo apt install ros-noetic-phidgets-spatial
3. catkin_make
4. Bind PhidgetUSB module with WSL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb

Launching IMU:
in shell: Bind IMU to WSL
1. usbipd list
2. usbipd attach --wsl --busid 2-2
Launch phidgets spatial node and run IMU transform script on ubuntu:
3. roslaunch phidgets_drivers/phidgets_spatial/launch/spatial.launch
4. python3 IMU_transform/src/scripts/transform.py
